# Roadmap

This impress.js Roadmap of what we want to achieve next so that contributors have an idea of what are our goals.

1. Improve tests, code and browser coverage to make sure we can evolve the code without breaking backwards compatibility (https://github.com/impress/impress.js/issues/575)

2. Document the current impress.js DOM Plugin API

3. Close existing requests and Pull Requests, implementing them in the current impress.js through the documented DOM Plugin API

4. Decouple impress.js core 3D engine from the monolith so that it can be used to build presentations not just for talks but also for websites

5. Enable mobile support
