Welcome to the impress.js wiki!

As the project is currently reviewed for optimization and maintenance, there will be some modifications in the source code and the Wiki.

To give a little bit of context, recently [a decision was made in the project](https://github.com/impress/impress.js/issues/435#issuecomment-177602861) to make the development more active and the first task is to clean up the repository, enhance the project and make it alive for good!

This is why there may be some "Todos" in the Wiki (as well as other issues/PRs) that await for some kind of reformation.
